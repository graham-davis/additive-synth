# Additive Synth
#### Graham Davis
#### Music 256a Fall 2016
#### Homework 1
For this assignment, I created an additive synth with four sine wave oscillators and a variety of customizable controls. The gain of each oscillator can be controlled individually using the four bar sliders. The _Gain_ rotary slider controls the overall gain of the synthesizer. The _Freq_ rotary slider controls the frequency of the fundamental oscillator (whose gain is controlled by the farthest left bar slider). The ratio of the harmonics is controlled by the _Ratio_ rotary slider. This slider determines the ratio (from 1:1 to 2:1) between the frequency of each oscillator and the preceding oscillator. Finally, the _Pan_ rotary slider controls the panning of the synthesizer as a whole.
